# TUI (Text-User-Interface) projects
This is a project of mine in c++. I am writing text-based applications in it via terminal using my own C++ header file as sort of like a library.

## How to use

Right now, none of the projects are complete, but the main header file : "consoleFunctions.hpp" is available to use with credit, and documentation will be available for it sometime in the near future.
The header file and current programs written with it require only the standard C++ libraries. However, because these projects use primarily a terminal/console, many of the features will not work on the Windows OS because of a lack of ANSI support.

## Terms of use
If you are wishing to use the header file for any project of your own, I have placed some comments at the bottom stating that I was the creator, do not remove them.
If you are wishing to download my projects for your own, there are lines of code that state that I was the creator somehow, do not remove them.
